## Objective of Task
To develop a greater global understanding and awareness of electrified roadways (E-Roads), as well as related technologies developed and deployment activities in the participating countries. This task includes a study of international standards (JARI, SAE, ISO/IEC), technical approaches, grid interactions, integration of the power grid into the road infrastructure, and identifying benefits/challenges related to E-Roads. 

There are four Technologies of Interest (TOI)s which Task 45 will focus on: 

- Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer (DWPT)  
- Non-road Conductive (Overhead)  
- Non-road conductive (Side)  
- In-road conductive 

## working method
The task will conduct bi-annual meetings which may include viewing locations of E-Roads research or deployment activities to gain first-hand knowledge of how this technology is progressing and to inform the HEV-TCP of new work. Based on information gathered from participating countries, specific areas may be identified as critical interest for further research. Task members will; 

- Develop an understanding of the challenges faced in various countries or markets by categorizing deployment approaches and requirements for E-Road technologies. 
- Conduct comparison of current technology development and address concerns for each of the TOIs. 
- Catalogue and compare standards (JARI, SAE, ISO/IEC) in areas such as power transfer, alignment or other vehicle controls, data security, and communications. 
- Summarize safety issues arising from vehicle to grid connections and road debris. 
- Understand the vehicle technology requirements and system resiliency plans for optimized E-Roads deployment at scale. 
- Catalogue potential grid impacts and understand grid requirements for at scale deployment of E-Road systems.â€¯
