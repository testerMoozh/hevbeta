## Objective of Task
Task 42 aims to collect learning and best practice from existing and planned large scale deployments of EVs around the world. The objective of the task is to highlight key global developments, provide insights on the role of policymakers in accelerating the uptake of EVs and offer guidance on how best to ramp-up and phase out public support. This involves answering three key questions:  

1. What are the incentives, investments and infrastructure that will drive growth in markets for EVs?  
2. How can the public and private sector work together to accelerate widespread uptake of electric vehicles?  
3. How will public policy need to change over time? 


The Casebook is designed for a large range of stakeholders including: city managers; city political leaders; national policy officials; national policy officials; managers in procurement, transport, and economic development; EV and transport industry; media; research; and other stakeholders. 

## working method
The Task will build on the approach and learning from previous successful Tasks (Task 18: EV Ecosystems and Task 22: EV Business Models). The scope will include different vehicle applications (private cars, ride-hailing and taxis, car sharing, fleet and delivery vehicles, buses) as well as different models of infrastructure deployment and different financing mechanisms.  

This casebook was informed by over 50 interviews with city managers and experts, covering cities in over 20 countries across the world. In total, these cities have populations of 160 million people. Insights were also drawn from desk research and the global networks of the Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI), the Hybrid and Electric Vehicle Technology Collaboration Program (HEV TCP), and partners. 

In addition, an online survey was run from May to September 2020 to ensure cities had an input into the process and put forward potential case studies. Two workshops were held virtually in September 2020 to validate our policy guidance findings, leading to our ten policy recommendations outlined in the Casebook. 

## Results
The EV City Casebook was successfully launched in an online webinar in March 2021. This casebook highlights inspiring examples from around the world of cities which have taken actions to accelerate mass adoption of EVs. The first five chapters profile different vehicle modes. Each chapter presents case study cities, with a brief description of their approach and key insights from their journey towards mass electric vehicle use. An EV Policy Maturity Model is outlined, to provide guidance to cities in benchmarking progress and to help cities identify where to further develop their efforts. 

The document is available here as well as on the IEA and HEV TCP websites. This project is a collaboration between the HEV TCP and EVI (Electric Vehicles Initiative which is an initiative by the Clean Energy Ministerial and run by the IEA). This collaboration has enabled input from the cities in the EVI Pilot City Program.
