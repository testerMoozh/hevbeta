## Objective of Task
Task 39 will focus on the charging infrastructure and more specifically on the interoperability aspects of e-mobility services like charging of passenger cars in the public and semi-public domain. 

Governments and industry are making huge investments in charging infrastructure in the public and semi-public domain to facilitate the further uptake of electric mobility and to try to convince the end users to make this step. These investments are certainly needed since charging will be needed, in more or less quantities, at all locations: residential, workplace and also the semi-public and public domain. 

However, it is not only about the quantity of available charging points in a region. Much more important is the quality of the charging service offered to the end user. This charging service needs to be easy to use, reliable and cost transparent. Information about the location and availability of charging points, about the way to get access to these charging points, about the tariffs, etc. are crucial for the end user to be confident enough to make the step towards electric mobility. Interoperability between the different e-mobility services offered today is therefore crucial for the comfort and ease-of-use of the end users. Look at the roaming in the telecom sector. But interoperability is equally important for the governments and companies making investments in charging infrastructure and services. Information exchange between the back offices of the different stakeholders like charge point operators and mobility service providers is an important aspect and having open and interoperable solutions can have a positive impact on the business case and on the flexibility to offer higher quality and/or combined e-mobility services to the end user. 

## working method
Task 39 will be executed in a pragmatic way and will make use of mainly telco's and two workshops to collect, discuss and write down the existing knowledge available from the experts of the member countries. This information will be complemented by additional desktop research and contacts with different initiatives to collect the most recent information.  

Putting the available information on paper in a clear and concise way and share it with the EV community (end users, governments and industry) is the ultimate ambition of Task 39. The country reports and recommendations will be shared via the Annual Report and the website of IEA HEV TCP. The working method and number of workshops can be adapted when new member countries join and/or opportunities arise.
