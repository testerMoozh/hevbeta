## Major Developments in 2020
#### A Healthy Environment and a Healthy Economy 
In December 2020, the Government of Canada announced its strengthened national climate plan: [A Healthy Environment and a Healthy Economy](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/news/2020/12/a-healthy-environment-and-a-healthy-economy.html). This plan builds on the work done to date and underway through the 2016 Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change (PCF) to further put Canada’s GHG emissions on a strong downward trend, exceed Canada’s 2030 Paris Agreement emission targets and establish the building blocks to achieve net-zero by 2050.
In addition to key measures supporting clean transportation to date, the strengthened climate plan builds on existing and contains new measures for the transportation sector, such as: 

-  Investing an additional 225 million USD over two years, starting in 2020-21, to continue the [incentives for zero-emission vehicles (iZEV) programme](https://tc.canada.ca/en/road-transportation/innovative-technologies/zero-emission-vehicles#/find/nearest?country=CA) until March 2022, which provides rebates of up to 3,925 USD on a light-duty zero-emission vehicle (ZEV); 
-  Investing an additional 117 million USD over three years in charging and low-carbon refueling stations across Canada; 
-  Working with partners on supply-side policy options to achieve additional GHG reductions from Canada’s LDV fleet; 
-  Aiming to align Canada’s LDV regulations with the most stringent performance standards in North America post-2025; 
-  Expanding the current [100% tax write off](https://tc.canada.ca/en/road-transportation/innovative-technologies/zero-emission-vehicles#/find/nearest?country=CA) to include commercial light-duty, medium- and heavy-duty ZEVs;  
-  Improving the efficiency of heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) standards for post-2025 by aligning with the most stringent standards in North America; and, 
-  Advancing the government’s commitment to help procure 5,000 zero-emission public transit buses and school buses. To support this goal, the [Canada Infrastructure Bank’s Growth Plan](https://cib-bic.ca/en/partner-with-us/growth-plan/) has earmarked 1.18 billion USD to expand and accelerate the adoption of zero emission buses.  
#### Hydrogen Strategy for Canada 
In December 2020, the Government of Canada launched the [Hydrogen Strategy for Canada](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/climate-change/the-hydrogen-strategy/23080), a framework that seeks to position Canada as a global hydrogen leader and as a key part of Canada’s path to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.  
#### Development of Codes and Standards for ZEVs   
The Government of Canada is contributing [1.33 million USD over 4 years to codes and standards development](https://www.canada.ca/en/natural-resources-canada/news/2020/09/investing-in-canadas-zero-emission-vehicle-sector.html) to help accelerate the demonstration, deployment and market entry of next-generation clean energy infrastructure.  
#### Launch of the Net Zero Accelerators Fund 
In December 2020, the Government of Canada announced that it will be investing 2.36 billion USD over 5 years through the Strategic Innovation Fund’s (SIF) new [Net Zero Accelerator fund](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/125.nsf/eng/00039.html) to rapidly expedite decarbonisation projects with large emitters, scale-up clean technology and accelerate Canada's industrial transformation across all sectors, including the automotive and aerospace sectors.  
#### The Global Drive to Zero Launch   
The [Global Drive to Zero](https://impact.canada.ca/en/challenges/charging-the-future), launched at the 11th CEM in September 2020, aims to enable and accelerate the growth of global zero- and near-zero-emission commercial vehicles.    
#### Investment into the Automotive Sector toward Low and Zero-Emission Vehicle Production    
While the COVID-19 pandemic had a disruptive effect felt strongly by the automotive sector, 2020 witnessed significant investments that will position the Canadian automotive sector to pivot to low- and zero-emission vehicle production, including:  
- Ford Motor Company of Canada will [invest 1.41 billion USD in Oakville](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/ca/en/news/2020/09/28/ford-commits-to-investing-1-8-billion.html) to convert it into Canada’s first battery electric vehicle manufacturing facility, and 116 million USD in the Windsor engine plant; 
- Stellantis (formally FCA) plans to [invest up to 1.18 billion USD in Windsor](https://www.unifor.org/en/whats-new/press-room/deal-fiat-chrysler-secures-15-billion-electric-vehicle-investment) for an electrified platform. The company will also invest 39 million USD in Brampton for new product variants; and 
- General Motors plans to [invest up to 1 billion USD](https://media.gm.ca/media/ca/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/ca/en/2020/Nov/1105_Negotiations.html) to reopen the Oshawa facility for production, and add further production at their St. Catherines facility. St. Catherines also saw investment into a Renewable Energy Cogeneration project. 

## Outlook   
Canada continue to support the adoption of EVs with targeted policies and an integrated approach to tackling climate change.
